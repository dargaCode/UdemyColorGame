# Color Match Game
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS</strong>

Another <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Udemy course</a> project. Display random swatches and challenge the user to select the one matching the RGB value.

While working on this, I’ve actually gotten quite a bit better at identifying the correct RGB color, which is a nice bonus.

Up next I’ll be moving back into jQuery, but I’m really glad I spent a few projects doing DOM manipulations with vanilla JS first.
