# Color Match Game
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS</strong>

Another <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Udemy course</a> project. Display random swatches and challenge the user to select the one matching the RGB value.

While working on this, I’ve actually gotten quite a bit better at identifying the correct RGB color, which is a nice bonus.

Up next I’ll be moving back into jQuery, but I’m really glad I spent a few projects doing DOM manipulations with vanilla JS first.

# Update: 

After learning about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>, I decided to go back and make the page remember the difficulty setting between sessions. 

This required a decent amount of refactoring. While I was at it, I added an Expert difficulty.
